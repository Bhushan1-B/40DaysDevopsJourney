40-Day DevOps Crash Plan (Simulated 3-Year Skillset)
Phase 1 – Core Foundations (Days 1–7)
Goal: Build strong base in Linux, Git, and core DevOps mindset.

Linux Mastery

File system, permissions, processes (ps, top, kill, grep, awk, sed).

Networking basics (ping, netstat, curl, wget, ssh).

Shell scripting (bash loops, conditions, automation).

Git & GitHub

Branching, merging, resolving conflicts, pull requests.

Git workflows (Gitflow, trunk-based).

Concepts to understand deeply

CI/CD basics.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) idea.

Why DevOps exists (culture, automation, feedback loop).

Phase 2 – Core DevOps Tools (Days 8–20)
Goal: Master key tools used in real jobs.

Docker (Days 8–10)

Build images, run containers, volumes, networks.

Multi-container with Docker Compose.

Kubernetes (Days 11–14)

Pods, deployments, services, config maps, secrets.

Minikube/local Kubernetes for practice.

Jenkins / GitHub Actions (Days 15–17)

Build a pipeline that builds Docker images, runs tests, and deploys to Kubernetes.

Terraform (Days 18–20)

AWS provider basics (EC2, S3, IAM).

Modules, variables, and state management.

Phase 3 – Cloud & Automation (Days 21–30)
Goal: Get real cloud deployment experience.

AWS (core services)

EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, CloudFormation basics.

Deploy a 2-tier app (frontend + backend) on AWS.

Ansible

Playbooks for installing packages, configuring servers.

Monitoring & Logging

Prometheus + Grafana basics.

Log shipping with ELK stack or CloudWatch.

Phase 4 – Project & Interview Prep (Days 31–40)
Goal: Create portfolio + gain “battle scars” through simulation.

Build 2–3 Real Projects:

CI/CD Pipeline for a Node.js app → Docker → K8s → AWS.

Terraform + Ansible to provision and configure infra.

Monitoring Dashboard with alerts.

Interview Prep:

Common DevOps scenarios (“Pipeline failed after push — what now?”, “K8s pod in CrashLoopBackOff — steps?”).

Whiteboard IaC designs.

💡 How to pull this off:

Dedicate 6–8 hours daily (2–3 before work, 4–5 after).

Follow practice > reading ratio of 70:30.

Use cloud free tiers (AWS Free Tier, GCP free credits, Azure free).

Push all projects to GitHub for portfolio proof.

If you want, I can turn this into a daily hour-by-hour roadmap with exact commands, labs, and tasks so you just follow and build like you’re on a real job. That way, 40 days won’t just give you “theory” — you’ll have portfolio proof of “3 years worth” of work.

Do you want me to make that day-by-day DevOps battle plan? That’s where the magic really happens.
